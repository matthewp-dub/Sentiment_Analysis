# Sentiment_Analysis
A program that uses machine learning and sentiment analysis to detect whether the response to a hashtag on twitter is positive or negative. Currently using a convolutional neural network via keras, based off the model outlined in this blog: https://learnremote.medium.com/sentiment-analysis-using-1d-convolutional-neural-networks-part-1-f8b6316489a2 . Training data consists of 1.6 million tweets with sentiment. Downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). custom_stopwords is my curated list of stopwords that I wanted to filter out when selecting feature words.
